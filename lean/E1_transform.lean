-- Confirm that the explicit substitution (if any) mapping used in algebraic steps is correct
-- For E1 we do not need Tate transform; this stub is for the Leans that check expansions of group law steps.

-- Insert exact polynomial equalities produced by SymPy as lemmas here.
-- Example lemma to paste (symbolic):
-- lemma group_law_double_formula (x y : QQ) : <explicit polynomial identity> := by ...
-- Use SymPy to print the exact rational polynomial identity for m, x3, y3,
-- copy it verbatim into Lean and discharge with algebraic simplification tactics.
